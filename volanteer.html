  <h2>Volunteer</h2>

  <p>So you'd like to help? Well, thanks! We have many exciting opportunities for volunteering.</p>

  <h3>Review truth submissions</h3>
  <p>We are constantly getting so many submissions of new language truths through our online form. Our small team, while tireless, simply can't keep up with the deluge. If you believe you are qualified, which is a big if, and you would be interested in going through our 27-point training program to be a Society for Truth in Language Officially Certified Language Truth Reviewer, <a href="contact.html">electronically mail us</a> your application. We will respond within 51 days.</p>

  <h3>Spread the word</h3>
  <p>Anyone can help by spreading the word! Our message is a strong one, but for some reason it's not as widely spread out as we'd like it to be.
    <ul>
      <li>Download and print out one of our free downloadable flyers and post it at your local bulletin board!</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="flyer.pdf" download="language-truth-flyer.pdf">DOWNLOAD HERE</a></li>
          <li>Take a picture of the flier you posted and share on the Instant Telegram application. Tag us in your post: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thesocietyfortruthinlanguage/">@thesocietyfortruthinlanguage</a>. Also, use the hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/thesocietyfortruthinlanguage">#thesocietyfortruthinlanguage</a> to help spread the hyper energy.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Bring our mission up in conversation with your local friends, family, boss, and radio stations!</li>
      <li>If you are a marketing professional, please <a href="contact.html">say hello</a> and let us know how you can help</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Testimonials</h3>
  <p>Do you carry a story with you every day about how Language Truth changed your life? If so, we want to hear it. Please share your story so we can use it in testimonals and potential academic papers that advance our mission.</p>

  <h3>Fundraising</h3>
  <p>As a not-for-profit organization, we need help coordinating fundraisers and writing grants. If you can help us with this, please <a href="contact.html">reach out</a>!</p>

  <h3>Coordinating volunteers</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, our minimal staff doesn't have so much time to coordinate the hordes of volunteers breaking in our doors to volunteer with The Society for Truth in Language. We need volunteers to help coordinate other volunteers. If you have skills in this area, we'd love to hear from you. Please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
